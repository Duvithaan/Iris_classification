# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project implements a simple **Iris Flower Classification** model using machine learning. The model predicts the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on features such as petal and sepal length and width.


## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) (available from scikit-learn)
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression (can be changed to SVM, Decision Trees, etc.)
- **Notebook**: `iris_classification.ipynb` contains:
  - Data loading and visualization
  - Train-test split
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Accuracy reporting

## Features

- Clean and simple implementation
- Easy-to-understand visualizations
- Well-commented for beginners
- Predictive model with decent accuracy

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas` â€“ Data manipulation
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` â€“ Visualization
- `scikit-learn` â€“ ML algorithms and model evaluation

---

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in predicting iris species and is suitable as a beginner-level ML classification example.



## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```
3. Run the notebook:
    - In Jupyter Notebook
    - Or in Google Colab
    - vs code(python/jupyter notebooks)
4. Experiment by modifying the model or dataset!



##  Future Ideas

- Try other classification algorithms like SVM, KNN, or Random Forest
- Perform cross-validation
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
